title: Diego components and architecture
owner: Diego
---

This topic tells you about the components that form and interact
with the Diego system in <%= vars.app_runtime_first %>.

<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> uses the Diego system to manage app containers. Diego components assume app scheduling and management responsibility from the Cloud Controller.

Diego is a self-healing container management system that attempts to keep the correct number of instances running in Diego cells to avoid network failures and crashes. Diego schedules and runs Tasks and Long-Running Processes (LRP). For more information about Tasks and LRPs, see [How the Diego Auction Allocates Jobs](diego-auction.html).

You can submit, update, and retrieve the desired number of Tasks and LRPs using the Bulletin Board System (BBS) API. For more information, see the [BBS Server](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bbs) repository on GitHub.


## <a id='diagram'></a> Learning how Diego runs an app

The following sections describe how Diego handles a request to run an app.
This is only one of the processes that happen in Diego. For example, running an app assumes the app has
already been staged.

For more information about the staging process, see [How Apps are Staged](../how-applications-are-staged.html).

The following illustrations and descriptions do not include all of the components of Diego.
For information about each Diego component, see [Diego Components](#components).

The architecture discussed in the following steps includes the following high level blocks:

* api - cloud_controller_ng
* scheduler - auctioneer
* diego-api - bbs
* pxc-mysql - bbs db
* diego-cell - rep/executor, garden, loggregator-agent, route-emitter
* singleton-blobstore - droplets
* doppler - doppler
* log-api - traffic-controller
* gorouter - gorouter

<%= vars.vm_note %>

### <a id='step-1'></a> Step 1: Receiving the request to run an app

Cloud Controller passes requests to run apps to the Diego BBS, which stores information about the request
in its database.

### <a id='step-2'></a> Step 2: Passing the request to the auctioneer process

The BBS contacts the Auctioneer to create an auction based on the desired resources for the app.
It references the information stored in its database.

### <a id='step-3'></a> Step 3: Performing the auction

Through an auction, the Auctioneer finds a Diego Cell to run the app on.
The Rep job on the Diego Cell accepts the auction request.

### <a id='step-4'></a> Step 4: Creating the container and running the app

The in process Executor creates a Garden container in the Diego Cell.
Garden downloads the droplet that resulted from the staging process and runs the app in the container.

### <a id='step-5'></a> Step 5: Emitting a route for the app

The `route-emitter` process emits a route registration message to Gorouter for the new app running on the Diego Cell.

### <a id='step-6'></a> Step 6: Sending logs to the Loggregator

Loggregator agent forwards app logs, errors, and metrics to the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> Loggregator.

For more information, see [App Logging in <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>](../../devguide/deploy-apps/streaming-logs.html).

## <a id='maximum-diego-cells'></a> Maximum recommended Diego Cells

The maximum recommended Diego Cells is 250 Cells for each <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> deployment. By default, there is a hard limit of 256 addresses for vSphere deployments that use Silk for networking. This hard limit is described in the [Silk Release documentation](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-networking-release/blob/develop/docs/large_deployments.md) on GitHub.

The default CIDR address block for the overlay network is 10.255.0.0/16. Each Diego Cell requires a subnet, and subnets (0-255) for each Diego Cell are allocated out of this network.

<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> deployments that do not use Silk for networking do not have a hard limit. However, operating a foundation with more than 250 Diego Cells is not recommended for the following reasons:

* Changes to the foundation can take a long time, potentially days or weeks depending on the `max-in-flight` value. For example, if there is a certificate expiring in a week, there might not be enough time to rotate the certificates before expiry. <%= vars.best_practices_link %>
* A single foundation still has single points of failure, such as the certificates on the platform. The RAM that 250 Diego Cells provides is enough to host many business-critical apps.

### <a id='app-lifecycles'></a> App lifecycle binaries

The following platform-specific binaries deploy apps and govern their lifecycle:

* The **Builder**, which stages a <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> app. The Builder runs as a Task on every staging request. It performs static analysis on the app code and does any necessary pre-processing before the app is first run.

* The **Launcher**, which runs a <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> app. The Launcher is set as the Action on the `DesiredLRP` for the app. It runs the start command with the correct system context, including working directory and environment variables.

* The **Healthcheck**, which performs a status check on running <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> app from inside the container. The Healthcheck is set as the CheckDefinition on the `DesiredLRP` for the app.

#### <a id='lifecycle-implementations'></a> Current implementations

* The buildpack app lifecycle implements the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> buildpack-based deployment strategy. For more information, see the [buildpackapplifecycle](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/buildpackapplifecycle) repository on GitHub.

* The Docker app lifecycle implements a Docker deployment strategy. For more information, see the [dockerapplifecycle](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/dockerapplifecycle) repository on GitHub.
